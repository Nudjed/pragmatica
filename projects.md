                <h3 class="text-green pt-4">Challenge</h3>
                <p class="py-4">Generali is one of the worlds leading insurers with €68bn in premiums globally. Over the last two years, the leadership team have delivered an industrial turnaround strategy, focused on streamlining operations, paving the way for the next phase of development. The new strategy “Generali 2021”, which includes a €1bn investment into Innovation & Digital Transformation, ultimately aiming to deliver higher growth, with consistent profit %age.</p>
                <p class="py-4 font-bold font-green-dark">But with over 50, 000 staff, 150,000 agents and 57million customers spread over 50 countries, leveraging the resources required to deliver meaningful Innovation & Digital Transformation is a complex challenge.</p>

                <h3 class="text-green pt-4">Solution</h3>
                <p class="py-4">Working with one of Generali’s Business Units - MyDrive Solutions, a former Pragmatica Portfolio business - we developed a vision and operational strategy to meet the innovation requirements of an organisation of Generali’s scale. Ecosistemi Digitali - Generali (ED-GE), leverages four key opportunities:</p>
                <ul class="py-4 text-sm"><li>Generali Business Unites are already seeking out external capabilities to support their transformation, however, this engagement model can be fragile and requires careful nurturing</li>
                <li>Digital Startups have access to motivated talent and the ability to quickly attract risk capital to new opportunities. However, they often lack access to market which is critical for them to test, prove and scale</li>
                <li>MyDrive has a unique position within Generali and the London Fintech scene. With access to the skills, experience and credibility to support BUs and Startups to work together, and to deploy inherent technical capability</li>
                <li>Longer-term, this model would provide opportunities for other strategic partners to join ED-GE, sharing resources to create significant enterprise value.</li></ul>

                <h3 class="text-green pt-4">Outcome</h3>
                <p class="py-4 font-bold font-green-dark">ED-GE creates a vehicle for Generali that is capable of delivering ~100 I&DT projects and  £150m of combined commercial value within the 2021 strategy, with further scalable benefits longer term, including the potential to diversify investments.</p>

<p>The Zealous Ecosystem - Wales' accelerator for social good. 
Challenge
Wales is a country of ~2m people, with a strong cultural identity, located in the West of the United Kingdom. As with many regions Wales has struggled with the challenge of developing alternatives to an industrial and agricultural economy, put under pressure by global competitors. This is coupled with a larger than the average public sector, low GDP per capita and a broad range of social challenges that will see costs increase over time.
The Welsh Government are therefore keen to find ways to accelerate the growth of the Welsh businesses, particularly digital
Solution
The Zealous Ecosystem is based on Pragmatica’s Innovation Engine, but focuses on delivering:
Social Innovation - supporting the public sector in Wales to become more efficient
Business creation - focusing on leveraging IP within startups as a vehicle to drive exports and therefore return on investment.
The model has been developed and tested through extensive consulting and trials in healthcare and transport. Research indicates there is a £250m cost release opportunity in Welsh Public services and a £370m export opportunity from the resulting innovations, over the next 10 years.
Zealous is constructed of three key processes:
Digital - a platform built with the personal and public service data that is now ubiquitous in our lives, based on a set of standards that support interoperability
Needs/Value - a human-centered design process, that focuses on finding and answering strategic needs within Wales
Commercialisation - the mechanisms to fund, sustain, scale and return value from the projects and IP created
The cycles of the model enable safe, scalable solutions to be funded and developed in Wales for the benefit of Welsh Society, then exported to the rest of the world, funding further developments. 
Market Entry for Everything Everywhere
Challenge
Everything Everywhere was looking to leverage opportunities arising from cloud-based technologies to drive revenues from data services. The challenge was to develop and deploy customer propositions that significantly increase new revenue stream opportunities, whilst working within the constraints of joint-venture ownership and legacy.
Solution
We built the demand landscape for identified propositions in each of the targeted markets, taking into account the emergence of OTT players as well as the expected growth in demand for such propositions. An operational assessment was also undertaken to establish innovation process, technology and people capabilities necessary for developing and launching new propositions. The outcome was a firmly embedded go-to-market strategy and proposition delivery framework that is generating new revenues from year1, in addition to better market positioning.
Taking Telematics to Market -  MyDrive Solutions
Challenge
MyDrive Solutions a bootstrapped start-up with minimum viable telematics proposition was looking to entry insurance market providing solutions for pay-how-you-drive product and transition from a two-person team to exciting commercial entity.
Solution
A robust assessment of people capabilities and value proposition was undertaken. Various market entry scenarios were developed, business model tested for each scenario, exigencies of each discrete market analysed, and leadership provided to ensure a successful market launch and acceptance. Identified and prioritised the markets that represented the greatest opportunities for their business paving the way for the creation of leading insurance telematics provider. This project culminated with the sale of MyDrive Solutions to Generali Group.</p>
