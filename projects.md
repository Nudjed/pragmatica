                <h3 class="text-green t-4">Solution</h3>
                <p class="py-4">Working with one of Generali’s Business Units - MyDrive Solutions, a former Pragmatica Portfolio business - we developed a vision and operational strategy to meet the innovation requirements of an organisation of Generali’s scale. Ecosistemi Digitali - Generali (ED-GE), leverages four key opportunities:</p>
                <ul class="pb-4">
                <li class="py-2">Generali Business Unites are already seeking out external capabilities to support their transformation, however, this engagement model can be fragile and requires careful nurturing</li>
                <li class="py-2">Digital Startups have access to motivated talent and the ability to quickly attract risk capital to new opportunities. However, they often lack access to market which is critical for them to test, prove and scale</li>
                <li class="py-2">MyDrive has a unique position within Generali and the London Fintech scene. With access to the skills, experience and credibility to support BUs and Startups to work together, and to deploy inherent technical capability</li>
               <li class="py-2">Longer-term, this model would provide opportunities for other strategic partners to join ED-GE, sharing resources to create significant enterprise value.</li>
               </ul>

                <h3 class="text-blue-darker">Outcome</h3>
                <p class="pt-4 font-bold font-green-dark">ED-GE creates a vehicle for Generali that is capable of delivering ~100 I&DT projects and  £150m of combined commercial value within the 2021 strategy, with further scalable benefits longer term, including the potential to diversify investments.</p>

            <div class="bg-white">
                <h3 class="text-green pt-4">Challenge</h3>
                <p class="py-4">Wales is a country of ~2m people, with a strong cultural identity, located in the West of the United Kingdom. As with many regions Wales has struggled with the challenge of developing alternatives to an industrial and agricultural economy, put under pressure by global competitors. This is coupled with a larger than the average public sector, low GDP per capita and a broad range of social challenges that will see costs increase over time.</p>
                <p class="py-4 font-bold font-green-dark">With mutiple challenges in economic growth, population change and service demand, Welsh Government are keen to find ways to accelerate the growth of digital businesses in Wales, particularly those focused on Social Innovation.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="">

            <div class="bg-white py-4">
                <h3 class="text-green t-4">Solution</h3>
                <p class="py-4">The Zealous Ecosystem is based on Pragmatica’s Innovation Engine, but focuses on delivering:</p>
                <ul class="pb-4">
                    <li class="py-2">Social Innovation - supporting the public sector in Wales to become more efficient</li>
                    <li class="py-2">Business creation - focusing on leveraging IP within startups as a vehicle to drive exports and therefore return on investment.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="py-4">Zealous is constructed of three key processes:</p>
                <ul class="pb-4">
                    <li class="py-2">Digital - a platform built with the personal and public service data that is now ubiquitous in our lives, based on a set of standards that support interoperability</li>
                    <li class="py-2">Needs/Value - a human-centered design process, that focuses on finding and answering strategic needs within Wales</li>
                    <li class="py-2">Commercialisation - the mechanisms to fund, sustain, scale and return value from the projects and IP created</li>
               </ul>
                <p class="py-4">The cycles of the model enable safe, scalable solutions to be funded and developed in Wales for the benefit of Welsh Society, then exported to the rest of the world, funding further developments.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="bg-white bg-blue-lightest rounded p-4 md:-m-4">
                <h3 class="text-blue-darker">Outcome</h3>
                <p class="pt-4 font-bold font-green-dark">The Zealous Ecosystem has been developed and tested through extensive consulting and trials in healthcare and transport. Research indicates there is a £250m cost release opportunity in Welsh Public services and a £370m export opportunity from the resulting innovations, over the next 10 years.</p>

                <h3 class="text-green t-4">Solution</h3>
                <p class="py-4">We built the demand landscape for identified propositions in each of the targeted markets, taking into account the emergence of OTT players as well as the expected growth in demand for such propositions. An operational assessment was also undertaken to establish innovation process, technology and people capabilities necessary for developing and launching new propositions.</p>
