<h3 class="text-green t-4">Solution</h3>
<p class="py-4">Working with one of Generali’s Business Units - MyDrive Solutions, a former Pragmatica Portfolio
business - we developed a vision and operational strategy to meet the innovation requirements of an
organisation of Generali’s scale. Ecosistemi Digitali - Generali (ED-GE), leverages four key opportunities:</p>
<ul class="pb-4">
<li class="py-2">Generali Business Unites are already seeking out external capabilities to support their
transformation, however, this engagement model can be fragile and requires careful nurturing</li>
<li class="py-2">Digital Startups have access to motivated talent and the ability to quickly attract risk
capital to new opportunities. However, they often lack access to market which is critical for them to test,
prove and scale</li>
<li class="py-2">MyDrive has a unique position within Generali and the London Fintech scene. With access to the
skills, experience and credibility to support BUs and Startups to work together, and to deploy inherent
technical capability</li>
<li class="py-2">Longer-term, this model would provide opportunities for other strategic partners to join
ED-GE, sharing resources to create significant enterprise value.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="text-blue-darker">Outcome</h3>
<p class="pt-4 font-bold font-green-dark">ED-GE creates a vehicle for Generali that is capable of delivering ~100
I&DT projects and £150m of combined commercial value within the 2021 strategy, with further scalable benefits
longer term, including the potential to share investment in I&DT by creating Enterprise Value in ED-GE.</p>
