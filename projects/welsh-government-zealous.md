    <h3 class="text-green pt-4">Challenge</h3>
    <p class="py-4">Wales is a country of ~2m people, with a strong cultural identity, located in the West of the
        United Kingdom. As with many regions Wales has struggled with the challenge of developing alternatives to an
        industrial and agricultural economy, put under pressure by global competitors. This is coupled with a larger
        than the average public sector, low GDP per capita and a broad range of social challenges that will see costs
        increase over time.</p>

    <h3 class="text-green t-4">Solution</h3>
    <p class="py-4">The Zealous Ecosystem is based on Pragmatica’s Innovation Engine, but focuses on delivering:</p>
    <ul class="pb-4">
        <li class="py-2">Social Innovation - supporting the public sector in Wales to become more efficient</li>
        <li class="py-2">Business creation - focusing on leveraging IP within startups as a vehicle to drive exports
            and therefore return on investment.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="py-4">Zealous is constructed of three key processes:</p>
    <ul class="pb-4">
        <li class="py-2">Digital - a platform built with the personal and public service data that is now ubiquitous in
            our lives, based on a set of standards that support interoperability</li>
        <li class="py-2">Needs/Value - a human-centered design process, that focuses on finding and answering strategic
            needs within Wales</li>
        <li class="py-2">Commercialisation - the mechanisms to fund, sustain, scale and return value from the projects
            and IP created</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="py-4">The cycles of the model enable safe, scalable solutions to be funded and developed in Wales for the
        benefit of Welsh Society, then exported to the rest of the world, funding further developments.</p>

    <h3 class="text-blue-darker">Outcome</h3>
    <p class="pt-4 font-bold font-green-dark">The Zealous Ecosystem has been developed and tested through extensive
        consulting and trials in healthcare and transport. Research indicates there is a £250m cost release opportunity
        in Welsh Public services and a £370m export opportunity from the resulting innovations, over the next 10 years.</p>
